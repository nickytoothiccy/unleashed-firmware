# GPIO Application Explanation

## Introduction to the GPIO Application

The GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) application is a part of the Flipper Zero's main applications. It provides functionality to interact with the device's GPIO pins, offering features such as pin testing and a USB-UART bridge.

## Application Structure

The GPIO application follows a modular structure, utilizing the scene management pattern for handling different states and views. The main components of the application are:

1. Main application files (gpio_app.h, gpio_app.c)
2. Scene management (scenes directory)
3. Views (views directory)
4. GPIO items handling (gpio_items.c, gpio_items.h)
5. USB-UART bridge functionality (usb_uart_bridge.c, usb_uart_bridge.h)

## Key Components

### GpioApp Structure

The `GpioApp` structure (defined in gpio_app_i.h) is the main container for the application state. It includes:

- GUI and view management components (gui, view_dispatcher, scene_manager)
- Various views (dialog, var_item_list, gpio_test, widget, gpio_usb_uart)
- GPIO items
- Notification and expansion records

### Scene Management

The application uses a scene manager to handle different states and transitions. Scenes are defined in the `scenes` directory, with each scene representing a different screen or state in the application.

### Views

The application uses several views to present information and interact with the user:

- Variable item list (for settings and options)
- GPIO test view (for testing GPIO pins)
- USB UART view (for the USB-UART bridge functionality)
- Widget (for displaying messages)
- Dialog (for confirmations)

## Main Functions and Their Purposes

### gpio_app_alloc()

This function initializes the GPIO application:
- Allocates memory for the GpioApp structure
- Sets up the GUI, view dispatcher, and scene manager
- Initializes various views
- Starts the initial scene (GpioSceneStart)

### gpio_app_free()

This function cleans up and frees resources used by the GPIO application:
- Removes and frees views
- Frees the view dispatcher and scene manager
- Closes system records
- Frees allocated memory

### gpio_app()

The main entry point of the GPIO application. It allocates the application, runs the view dispatcher, and then frees the application when it's done.

## Scene Management

The application uses several scenes to manage different states:

- Start scene
- Test scene
- USB UART scene
- USB UART configuration scene
- USB UART close RPC scene

Each scene is responsible for setting up its specific view and handling user interactions.

## Views and User Interface

The application provides several views for user interaction:

- GPIO Test view: Allows users to test and monitor GPIO pins
- USB UART view: Provides interface for the USB-UART bridge functionality
- Variable Item List view: Used for configuration and settings
- Widget view: Used for displaying messages and notifications
- Dialog view: Used for confirmations and alerts

## USB UART Bridge Functionality

The GPIO application includes a USB-UART bridge feature, allowing the Flipper Zero to act as a bridge between USB and UART interfaces. This functionality is implemented in the usb_uart_bridge.c and usb_uart_bridge.h files.

## Best Practices for Using the GPIO Application

When working with or extending the GPIO application:

1. Follow the existing scene management pattern when adding new functionality.
2. Use the provided views and extend them as needed, maintaining consistency in the user interface.
3. Properly manage resources, ensuring that allocated memory and opened records are properly freed and closed.
4. When interacting with GPIO pins, always consider the potential impact on the hardware and implement necessary safeguards.
5. For USB-UART bridge functionality, ensure proper error handling and data integrity checks.

## Conclusion

The GPIO application provides a flexible and powerful interface for interacting with the Flipper Zero's GPIO capabilities. Its modular structure and use of scene management allow for easy extension and modification. Understanding its components and structure is crucial for effectively using or extending its functionality.
